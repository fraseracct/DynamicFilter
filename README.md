# DynamicFilter
Example of integrating Dynamic Language (Groovy) into javax.servlet.Filter

Example of an servlet filter using OSGi and an externalized Groovy script. OSGi allows plugin of the filter. Use of the Groovy language can reduce complexity and time to customize a filter. Once the plugin is started, the script can be tested, adjusted, and retested without restart or compilation.
